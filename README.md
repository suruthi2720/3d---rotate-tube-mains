# 3d---rotate-tube-mains
A 3D Rotate Tube Main is a central tube-shaped object that spins around one or more axes (X, Y, or Z) in 3D space. It is used in animation, design, and simulations to create dynamic motion for pipes, rollers, or structures, often controlled by animation, physics, or user input.
